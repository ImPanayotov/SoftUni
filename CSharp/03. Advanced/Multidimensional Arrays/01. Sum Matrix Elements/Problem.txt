1.	Sum Matrix Elements
Write program that reads a matrix from the console and print:
•	Count of rows
•	Count of columns
•	Sum of all matrix elements
On first line you will get matrix sizes in format [rows, columns]
Examples
Input						Output
3, 6						3
7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1			6
1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6			76
4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0

Hints
•	On next [rows] lines you will get elements for each column separated with coma and whitespace
•	Try to use only foreach for printing
