Write a program that finds the sum of matrix primary diagonal.
 
		0	1	2

   0  [11]  2   4

   1  [4]	5	6

   2   10	8  [-12]

   primary diagonal
   sum = 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

Input
•	On the first line, you are given the integer N – the size of the square matrix
•	The next N lines holds the values for every row – N numbers separated by a space
Examples
