1.	Diagonal Difference
Write a program that finds the difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals (absolute value).
 
Input
•	On the first line, you are given the integer N – the size of the square matrix
•	The next N lines holds the values for every row – N numbers separated by a space
Output
•	Print the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and the secondary diagonal
Examples
Input		Output			Comments
3			15				Primary diagonal: sum = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4
11 2 4						Secondary diagonal: sum = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
4 5 6						Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
10 8 -12
